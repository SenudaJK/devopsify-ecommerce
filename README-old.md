  - **database**: Contains migration files for managing the PostgreSQL database schema.

- **infrastructure**: Contains Terraform and Kubernetes configurations for provisioning and deploying the application.
  - **terraform**: Terraform modules and environment configurations.
  - **kubernetes**: Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts for deploying the application components.

- **.github**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD.
  - **workflows**: CI and CD workflow definitions.

- **gitops**: Contains configurations for ArgoCD to manage GitOps deployments.

- **monitoring**: Contains configurations for monitoring the application using Prometheus and Grafana.

- **docs**: Documentation for the architecture and deployment processes.

- **docker-compose.yml**: Configuration for running the application locally using Docker Compose.

- **Dockerfile**: Instructions for building the Docker image for the application.
