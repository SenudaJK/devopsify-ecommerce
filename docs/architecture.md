# Architecture Overview of DevOpsify E-Commerce Application

## Project Structure

The DevOpsify E-Commerce application is structured into several key components, each serving a specific purpose in the overall architecture. Below is an overview of the main directories and their roles:

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the application, divided into frontend, backend, and database components.
  - **frontend/**: Built using React/Next.js, this directory includes reusable components and page definitions.
  - **backend/**: Developed with Node.js/Express, this directory handles API requests, business logic, and database interactions.
  - **database/**: Manages database migrations to ensure schema changes are applied consistently.

- **infrastructure/**: Contains the infrastructure as code (IaC) configurations.
  - **terraform/**: Holds Terraform modules and environment configurations for provisioning cloud resources.
  - **kubernetes/**: Includes Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts for deploying the application components on a Kubernetes cluster.

- **.github/**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD).
  - **workflows/**: Defines the CI/CD processes for building, testing, and deploying the application.

- **gitops/**: Manages GitOps configurations using ArgoCD for automated deployments.
  - **argocd/**: Contains ArgoCD application definitions and sync settings.
  - **applications/**: Holds application-specific configurations for GitOps.

- **monitoring/**: Contains configurations for monitoring the application.
  - **prometheus/**: Includes Prometheus configurations for metrics collection.
  - **grafana/**: Contains Grafana dashboard configurations for visualizing metrics.

- **docs/**: Provides documentation for the project, including architecture and deployment processes.

## Architecture Components

### Frontend

The frontend is a React/Next.js application that provides a user-friendly interface for customers to browse products, manage their cart, and complete purchases. It communicates with the backend API to fetch product data and handle user authentication.

### Backend

The backend is a Node.js/Express application that serves as the API layer for the frontend. It handles requests, processes business logic, and interacts with the PostgreSQL database to manage product information, user accounts, and orders.

### Database

The application uses PostgreSQL as its primary database for storing product data, user information, and order history. Database migrations are managed through the `src/database/migrations` directory to ensure schema changes are applied consistently across environments.

### Infrastructure

The infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform, which allows for consistent and repeatable deployments across different environments (development, staging, production). The infrastructure includes:

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network isolation.
- Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for container orchestration.
- RDS PostgreSQL for managed database services.
- S3 buckets for storing artifacts and logs.

### Deployment

The application is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster, with configurations managed through GitOps principles using ArgoCD. This allows for automated deployments and rollbacks based on changes in the Git repository.

### Monitoring

Monitoring is implemented using Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. This setup enables real-time monitoring of application performance, including API response times and database connections.

## Conclusion

The DevOpsify E-Commerce application is designed with a cloud-native architecture that leverages modern technologies and best practices in DevOps. This architecture not only supports scalability and maintainability but also ensures a smooth deployment process through CI/CD and GitOps methodologies.
