# Deployment Process for DevOpsify E-Commerce Application

This document outlines the deployment process for the DevOpsify E-Commerce application, detailing the steps required to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster using GitOps principles with ArgoCD.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the application, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., EKS, AKS, GKE).
- ArgoCD installed and configured on the Kubernetes cluster.
- Docker images for the frontend and backend services are pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GHCR).
- Terraform is used to provision the necessary infrastructure.

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Infrastructure Provisioning

1. Navigate to the `infrastructure/terraform` directory.
2. Configure the environment-specific variables in the `environments` folder.
3. Run the following command to provision the infrastructure:

   ```
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

### Step 2: Kubernetes Manifests

1. Ensure that the Kubernetes manifests for the frontend and backend services are located in `infrastructure/kubernetes/manifests`.
2. Verify that the manifests include necessary configurations such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.

### Step 3: ArgoCD Configuration

1. Navigate to the `gitops/argocd` directory.
2. Create an ArgoCD application definition that points to the Git repository containing the Kubernetes manifests.
3. Configure the sync policy to enable automatic synchronization with the Git repository.

### Step 4: Deploying the Application

1. Access the ArgoCD UI or use the CLI to sync the application.
2. Monitor the deployment process through the ArgoCD dashboard.
3. Ensure that all pods are running and healthy by checking the status:

   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```

### Step 5: Verification

1. Access the frontend application using the Ingress URL or LoadBalancer IP.
2. Test the application functionality to ensure that both frontend and backend services are working as expected.

### Step 6: Monitoring and Logging

1. Ensure that Prometheus and Grafana are set up for monitoring the application.
2. Check the Grafana dashboards for metrics related to application performance.
3. Review logs using the configured logging solution (e.g., Loki, ELK stack).

## Rollback Procedure

In case of deployment failure or issues:

1. Use ArgoCD to rollback to the previous stable version of the application.
2. Monitor the rollback process and verify that the application is restored to a healthy state.

## Conclusion

Following these steps will ensure a smooth deployment of the DevOpsify E-Commerce application using modern DevOps practices. For any issues or further assistance, refer to the project's documentation or reach out to the development team.
